z-img-desktop-updater
=====================

I use this to ping z-img.com with a search query and then parse their page for the image and set it as my backgroud. Could just as easily use Google, since that's what their sites using, but this was more fun. And linked off of /r/ScarlettJohansson.

##Example:

    main("Scarlett Johansson")

looks up a random "Scarlett Johansson hot" image, and sets it as your background

    main()

does something similar, but instead pulls a name from `searches.txt` and uses
that as the query instead.
